-> source : from someone's git repo, I forgot the name.

-> copy and paste your efficient solution (the one which is failing) in the efficient.cpp and copy and paste your naive solution (the one which is brute-force)(someone else's solution which is correct in case of practice)
generator.cpp
-> complete the make_test function in the generator.cpp file based on the input format given.

=> Common mistakes : 

-> using the same solution for both efficient.cpp and naive.cpp.
-> out of bound value in the input. (make sure you are outputting the value in the range given in the constraints)
-> wrong input format. (make sure you are maintaning the input format)

=> how much time : 

-> 2-3 minute for writing the brute-force, 2-5 minute for writing the generator, 2-30 minute for the finding the test-case.

=> When to use : 

-> when this is the only solution you have left.
-> you should check common type of errors first and then opt for the generator.
-> although, you can use it in the contest but consider doing it very very fast. and write efficient generator.(like thinking about the test case where your solution might fail and producing that type of input's)
-> good luck.


=> how to write efficient generator ?

-> later...

=> how to find the failing test case ?
